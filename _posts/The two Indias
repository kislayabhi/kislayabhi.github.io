1. What do you want your readers to get from reading this article?
   - To impress upon the general audience how easy it is to miss the venerable spirituality of India when one is mixed in the humdrum of social life.
   - That generally how over-proportionate the share of Cricket, Bollywood and Politics sucks up the conscience of anyone growing up in India. But the major problem is no one methodically teaches anything about the great philosophical traditions that were born in India and we only intake them via either Movies, or culturally through traditions or through the deadliest way - which is politics.
   - That we had a great ancient culture based on spiritual truths that never materialized and how uncanny it feels for any youth growing up in India to make sense of it. For you see parts and traces of it every where, say the Kumbh Mela, or the sciences developed in India such as Yoga and Meditation, that India is the source of five big religions and has accomodated within itself many more etc.
   - How our every festival - depending upon the region - is spiritually based - and how it all mixes.
   - For the evidence is all over the place, but all those ideas get mixed up at so many levels with other ideas that it is hard to drink from the spiritual fountain - and people rather die of thirst inspite of being too close to it.
   - Back this with the example of the great saints who never stopped coming to India - foremost Sri Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharishi - the latest of the two examples of that.
   - And mention the series of Philosopher saints that have come up over the years - especially Adi Shankaracharya, Kumarlila Bhatta, Mahavir, Buddha, Patanjali, Bhakti saints, Advaitic saints, Neem Karoli and more recently M.
   - That all the ideas where the origin of India is discussed either from the basis of
     - Race (that is indo aryan theory or the aryan invasion theory)
     - Or other pointers such as Economy/GDP
     - Or Education/Infrastrucutre development
     can never be the essential part of explaining India without leaving the philosophy and spirituality of India aside.
   - That the only way ahead for India is to generate world class humanities intellectuals known for their might in the whole world, to correctly frame this point of view. Unfortunately the humanities department of India is in shambles, where the output is of such low-grade quality that most of the ideas of India that dominate in the world still come from scholars who have not been touched by this cultural continuity and spirituality of India, and in their sweeping generalizations never took into consideration this cultural and thriving spiritual continuity of India which provides the life-force to billions of people, sometimes not-withstanding or unknowingly.

2. What do you want yourself to get from writing this article?
   - I want to understand if I can portray a complete picture of the ideas that I have in mind for India, which is a land primarily of Philosophy and Spirituality.
   - That people of this land have immense faith in God, and rather Reality, which is both personal and impersonal, a highly evolved thought of the Infinite, and this has been the vital pulse of India.
   - That I gain more expressiveness for the general reverence that I feel for this land, and could portray it in effective writing.
