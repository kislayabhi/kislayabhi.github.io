1. What do you want your readers to get from reading this article?
   - To impress upon the general audience how easy it is to miss the venerable spirituality of India when one is mixed in the humdrum of social life.
   - That generally how over-proportionate the share of Cricket and Bollywood sucks up the conscience of anyone growing up in India.
   - That we had a great ancient culture based on spiritual truths that never materialized and how uncanny it feels for any youth growing up in India to make sense of it.
   - How our every festival - depending upon the region - is spiritually based - and how it all mixes.
   - For the evidence is all over the place, but all those ideas get mixed up at so many levels with other ideas that it is hard to drink from the spiritual fountain - and people rather die of thirst inspite of being too close to it.
   - Back this with the example of the great saints who never stopped coming to India - foremost Sri Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharishi - the latest of the two examples of that.
   - And mention the series of Philosopher saints that have come up over the years - especially Adi Shankaracharya, 

2. What do you want yourself to get from writing this article?
   - I want to understand if I can portray a complete picture of the ideas that I have in mind for India, which is a land primarily of Philosophy and Spirituality.
   - That people of this land have immense faith in God, and rather Reality, which is both personal and impersonal, a highly evolved thought of the Infinite, and this has been the vital pulse of India.
   - That I gain more expressiveness for the general reverence that I feel for this land, and could portray it in effective writing.
