Why Communities?

* Giving your customers, users, and players a place to hang out and learn together gives businesses a chance to get invaluable insights, but more importantly creates something that every human being needs: a sense of belonging.
*  Community builders need to have a strong grasp on two essential concepts:
    * The community quadrant (to understand how community differs from other groups of people who interact with a product) - users/customers come first, followed by evangelists, and then
community. The formation of community is viable only once you have found some evangelists - people who are passionate about your product.
    * The community funnel (to understand what makes a community compelling to prospective members).
        1. They create a built-in source of real-time user feedback, which is critical for building a product people really want.
        2. They foster friendships rooted in an affinity for your product, which drives lifetime value and new customer referrals.
        3. Some tips: You need to set the stage for the new community members - by letting early members play a role in shaping and growing the community and also by creating an environment compelling enough to reel in anyone who enters.
