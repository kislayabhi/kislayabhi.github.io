Why Communities?

* Giving your customers, users, and players a place to hang out and learn together gives businesses a chance to get invaluable insights. Still, it more importantly creates something that every human being needs: a sense of belonging.
*  Community builders need to have a strong grasp of two essential concepts:
    * The community quadrant (to understand how the community differs from other groups of people who interact with a product) - users/customers come first, followed by evangelists, and then
the community. The formation of a community is viable only once you have found some evangelists - people who are passionate about your product.
    * The community funnel (to understand what makes a community compelling to prospective members).
        1. They create a built-in source of real-time user feedback, critical for building a product people want.
        2. They foster friendships rooted in an affinity for your product, which drives lifetime value and new customer referrals.
        3. Some tips: You need to set the stage for the new community members - by letting early members play a role in shaping and growing the community and also by creating an environment compelling enough to reel in anyone who enters.

Some great case studies:

1. Chip Morningstar and Randy Farmer
Cocreators of Lucasfilm Games “Habitat”. Some noteworthy anecdotes:
   * Farmer noted: "I had an idealism then, which I shared with my father, which was that the Internet would connect everyone and that great things would happen. People would cooperate more. There would be fewer wars. Now I’m not sure that throwing everyone into a big pile on the Internet was good design. **Over the years, I realized that the best communities are the ones that have shared content, and a shared purpose for existing, even if it’s temporary and on a smaller scale.**"
   * Farmer noted: I have consulted for a lot of virtual communities and that question is "What helps the community?". It is not a list of features that it has to have - chat, message boards, email relay, etc. At one point, I created a community around a podcast. When we moved from message boards to Discord, which values engagement metrics, the community lost its value, as thoughtful posts were lost among the chatter. In fact, chatter was promoted as it was produced by "more engaged users". It creates a brain drain.
   * When people think about community design, you have to start with "What does the community need?" That could even be utilizing email or SMS relay. **So my answer would be that you should architect the community to serve the community**

2. WELL
  * For a community to be successful, you need people who care as a part of it.
  * In addition to having an experienced facilitator from the beginning, you should identify the people in the community who are the most eager contributors and enlist them to help as you scale up. Your hosts, and your facilitators, should come from the most enthusiastic members of the community. These are people who have a stake in the community, but also it signals to everyone else that we, the community participants, are the owners of this virtual space. ** That feeling of ownership is key to feeling they can participate and take responsibility for the health of the space"
  * Atherton: If not a crossover with real-life interactions, what do you believe is needed to start a community? - Rheingold:
    * **One of the things you need is a strong center of gravity, something that is going to attract people to your online community, say, Harley Davidson motorcycles or a rare disease.**
  * What shift is required to turn an online discussion into a community?
    * One is to have people actively facilitating community and welcoming people. In my experience, the one factor that most affects whether someone who participates for the first time will return and continue to participate is whether anybody acknowledges their participation by name. There's nothing like having someone say they read your post. I can remember the first response that I had to my first post on the WELL. I said I wanted to talk about a certain topic, and someone said, "Oh goodie"; I just felt acknowledged and welcome.
