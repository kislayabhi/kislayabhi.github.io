Why Communities?

* Giving your customers, users, and players a place to hang out and learn together gives businesses a chance to get invaluable insights, but more importantly creates something that every human being needs: a sense of belonging.
*  Community builders need to have a strong grasp on two essential concepts:
    * The community quadrant (to understand how community differs from other groups of people who interact with a product) - users/customers come first, followed by evangelists, and then
community. The formation of community is viable only once you have found some evangelists - people who are passionate about your product.
    * The community funnel (to understand what makes a community compelling to prospective members).
        1. They create a built-in source of real-time user feedback, which is critical for building a product people really want.
        2. They foster friendships rooted in an affinity for your product, which drives lifetime value and new customer referrals.
        3. Some tips: You need to set the stage for the new community members - by letting early members play a role in shaping and growing the community and also by creating an environment compelling enough to reel in anyone who enters.

Some great case studies:

1. Chip Morningstar and Randy Farmer
Cocreators of Lucasfilm Games “Habitat”. Some noteworthy anecdotes:
   * Farmer noted: "I had an idealism then, which I shared with my father, which was that the Internet would connect everyone and that great things would happen. People would cooperate more. There would be fewer wars. Now I’m not sure that throwing everyone into a big pile on the Internet was good design. **Over the years, I realized that the best communities are the ones that have shared content, a shared purpose for existing, even if it’s temporary and on a smaller scale.**"
