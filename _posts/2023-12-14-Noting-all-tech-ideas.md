* A website that links the info for every single padma shri of India in a single place. And opens it up for people to comment on it.
  * Should automatically keep itself updated when the new awards are given.
  * https://www.padmaawards.gov.in/padmaawardees.aspx
  * https://abhijeetkislay.wixsite.com/idealsofbharat
* A website that explains the large behemoth that the Indian Spiritual Scene is.
  * It should start with a small list of books and the famous saints and sages who have worked on them.
* Crunch the insights from all the major outages via AI.
  * Looks like reading from a large PDF is still hard for LLMs.
* Build a NAS server for home use.
* An article on Two Indias.
* Put all the speeches given by Atal Bihari Vajpayee together in a single place so that one can consume them.
  * Create a Youtube playlist and possibly do Hindi transcription for each of them.
  * If the dates can also be provided alongside, that would be great!
* Eggnog Forum
  * Writing
    * The Elements of Style
        *  Simple thumb rules
    * LinkedIn Learning - the three-step process
        * Ideas collection - capture them
        * Drafting from the idea - 500 words
        * Editing that idea
        * Try to do these steps on separate days. That will help in coming at your idea and the article from multiple directions.
    * LinkedIn Learning - detailed study
        * When you start writing something, answer two questions, as descriptively as possible:
          * What do you want your readers to get out of your article/lecture?
          * What do you want yourself to get out of your article/lecture?
