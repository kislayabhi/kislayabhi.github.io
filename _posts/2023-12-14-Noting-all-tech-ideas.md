* A website that links the info for every single padma shri of India in a single place. And opens it up for people to comment on it.
  * Should automatically keep itself updated when the new awards are given.
  * https://www.padmaawards.gov.in/padmaawardees.aspx
  * https://abhijeetkislay.wixsite.com/idealsofbharat
* A website that explains the large behemoth that the Indian Spiritual Scene is.
  * It should start with a small list of books and the famous saints and sages who have worked on them.
* Crunch the insights from all the major outages via AI.
  * Looks like reading from a large PDF is still hard for LLMs.
* Build a NAS server for home use.
* An article on Two Indias.
  * This could also take some help from "The Razor's Edge" this scene specifically: [youtube](https://youtu.be/f9WrSkcbpvg)
  * To some extent I always wanted to chart how Vedanta subtly has promulgated in the American movie and novel scene. And funnily enough I got a really interesting article over here: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/movies-embraced-hinduism which is actually well done!
    * Movie Anubhav, this [article](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/29/anubhav.bollywood) led me to this: "the past comes between us only when we aren't able to live the present completely"
* What an awesome write Somerset Maugham is!
  * Article ["The Saint (1958)"](https://mmccl.blogspot.com/2016/01/the-saint.html) which describes his interaction with Ramana Maharishi. An excerpt which is useful for me:
     * "The Maharshi seldom spoke. For the most part he remained lost in contemplation; but merely to be in his presence enabled visitors to shake off their troubles and find peace. Sometimes they saw him suffused in brilliant light, but when they told him of this he brushed it off as a matter of no importance. They asked him questions. When they were frivolous, he maintained silence; when, however, he saw that they were in earnest he gave the instruction suited to the enquirer's need. It seemed to many that he could read their minds, for he would on occasion answer questions that they had not ventured to put to him. Many, influenced by his example, left their homes and came to the Ashram, desiring to lead the life of austerity which would lead them to the blessed state of union with the Infinite which is termed illumination. When the Maharshi knew that they had duties, a wife and mother dependent upon them, for instance, he dissuaded them from taking the step. Often persons came to ask whether their avocations could not but interfere with their spiritual efforts. Here is what he told one such enquirer: **"It is possible," he said, "to perform all the activities of life with detachment and regard only the Self as real. It is wrong to suppose that, if one is fixed in the Self, one's duties in life will not be properly performed. It is like an actor. He dresses and acts and even feels the part he is playing; but he knows that he is not that character, but someone else in real life. In the same way, why should the body-consciousness or the feeling 'I am the body' disturb you once you know that you are not the body, but the Self? Nothing that the body does should shake you from abidance in the Self. Such abidance will never interfere with the proper and effective discharge of whatever duties the body has, any more than the actor's being aware of his real status in life interferes with his acting a part on the stage.**""
  * And also of interest is the book "The Summing Up". Chapter 55 talks about how travel enriched him and made him look life differently after each of his trips.
  * Also it seems he used Ramana's character in the novel "The Razor's Edge" which later on was adapted two times for movies.
* Put all the speeches given by Atal Bihari Vajpayee together in a single place so that one can consume them.
  * Create a Youtube playlist and possibly do Hindi transcription for each of them.
  * If the dates can also be provided alongside, that would be great!

  * Writing
    * The Elements of Style
        *  Simple thumb rules
    * LinkedIn Learning - the three-step process
        * Ideas collection - capture them
        * Drafting from the idea - 500 words
        * Editing that idea
        * Try to do these steps on separate days. That will help in coming at your idea and the article from multiple directions.
    * LinkedIn Learning - detailed study
        * When you start writing something, answer two questions, as descriptively as possible:
          * What do you want your readers to get out of your article/lecture?
          * What do you want yourself to get out of your article/lecture?
