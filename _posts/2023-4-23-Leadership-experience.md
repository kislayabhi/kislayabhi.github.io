Leadership makes you responsible. This is what I am realizing. And it is forcing me to think about the dual nature of any work. Till now all the work that I did as Senior software developer - all my energy was spent in figuring out what I am getting out of the process.
As time progressed, and I studied Vedanta and Vivekananda on the side, I started realizing that this has been a very limited way to think about life. And a very selfish one - the outcome of which generally results in great dissatisfaction.

Prove this from your deep experience to excel in Computer Vision and ML -- and how after spending 4 years on it - I came to realize that it doesn't have any joy in it. I hit an extremely high wall.
Then through Vedanta, it became painstakingly evident to me that this "I" which I was thinking to be just this person Abhijeet - is not true. Rather this I is Infinite. There is no start nor any end to this I. That it is beginningless and it is deathless. Or to simplify this succinctly - I is Universal.
The world that I see through my eyes is also I. How weird! The duality was an appearance - there is no distinction between this world and myself. It is the same reality!

But what are the practical outcomes of this? Let's analyze.

1. The initial goal where I wanted to extract the greatest joy and excellence out of the work that I am doing --> is technically incorrect. Rather every goal should have two parts in it. First is of course - you should have some personal motivation - no doubt about it. This is needed to generate even some intention to move towards that direction. But the 2nd part of every goal should be - what benefits it provides to people around at large. It must have a resultant benefit for others because the I is Universal and not limited to personality. And this is the output of a thorough understanding of Vedanta. This is what Vivekananda did when he established the Ramakrishna Mission - the ideal he set was "Aatmano Mokshartha Jagat Hitaya Cha" - For one's liberation and the welfare of all.
2. Similarly this is something that is becoming extremely evident to me as I am moving to the leadership role. I am not only going to build leadership skills but also I am responsible for the career growth of the people whom I am supposed to lead. This twin nature of goal is becoming clear to me as I am stepping into this role. And a leader who doesn't take care of the latter part is - I would say very clearly - selfish and not suited for the role.

If I analyze my life, the 1st part of the goal requires a solid intellect - something which I have been trained and have honed for years. But if you look at the second part - it is about the heart. Who teaches how to grow your heart? No one! These teachings sometimes get wrapped up in terms like emotional intelligence or psychology etc. I understand there is a great deal of truth in these - but what I am realizing is that - all it amounts to is having deep sympathy for people around us. Sympathy for what they have been going through, sympathy about what their personality traits are, etc. How rare this knowledge is, and how precious it is once one starts feeling others as oneself. This is the path to true greatness - the path to true leadership. This is what Vivekananda used to say - to have infinite intellect and infinite heart. Such infallible statements. These will be true always.
