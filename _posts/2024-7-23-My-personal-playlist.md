I have since very recently started realizing that there are certain things out there in the world that I eternally vibe with, out of its natural composition. There are other things that I have to try hard to learn and understand before I can truly say that I enjoy them. To make sure all that I like is present in one place, I decided to keep it on this page to keep a note of all those things that I love watching/reading/listening to.
