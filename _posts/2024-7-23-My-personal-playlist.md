I only recently realized that there are certain things in the world that I eternally vibe with out of their natural composition. There are other things that I have to try hard to learn and understand before I can genuinely say that I enjoy them. To make sure all that I like is present in one place, I decided to keep it on this page to keep a note of all those things that I love watching/reading/listening to. 

## My own Instagram stories!

## Snippets of teachings that makes sense to me

* Providence
  - Do what is needed to be done, irrespective of whether you like it or not.
  - Be `businesslike` in your dealings with the world.
  - Don't pay too much attention to your mind.

* VSNY
  - `Abhijeet` will never become free, rather, `I` will become free from `Abhijeet`.
    - Here `Abhijeet` represents the mind or say the personality. 
 
* Vrindavan
  - "मैं" को ज्ञान नहीं होता है, जबकि, "ज्ञान" में "मैं" मालूम पड़ता है |
  - ईश्वर का केवल एक ही कानून है की वह भक्त पक्षपाती होता है |
  - ईश्वर का एक नाम है नटराज, मतलब, नाटकों के राजा।  हमें भी उनके जैसे नाटक करना आना चाहिए।

7. From Todo-lists to Themes!
8. Why "Fake it till you make it" is a maha-mantra!
   - It is an actionable statement
   - And it takes the seriousness away from life, which is why procrastination happens!

9. Kanwal Rekhi's [Oped](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kanwalrekhi_dot-hatao-desh-bachao-activity-7232880566948282368-RxL3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios) changed India's telecom industry during Vajpayee's tenure.
   - Knowing about this is fantastic because I have lived and seen the transformation in my growing years.
   - This gives me a great sense of purpose in how people have contributed during my years of growth.
   - Also, funnily, I read Sam Pitroda's book end to end while on a flight. It was a great read. But Kanwal and Sam are essentially compatriots. So you can see the disagreements between them very clearly. And that clarifies what works and what doesn't work.
   - It is sad that research initiatives, as lucrative as they might sound, don't have potential in India, for they require more of an execution mindset to grab a big market for villages, etc.

10. My Air India flight from Blore to Mumbai to NYC.
    - It got stuck where APU didn't work
    - so he can't shut the engines as that will kill the power
    - but if he doesn't shut the engine, the door can't be opened!
    - It's a gruesome three-way lock!
   
11. My love-hate affair with Gym
    - There is a need for an instructor who made a difference!
    - Paying money for the right cause is a purifying process - read somewhere in Antifragile
   
12. Peru's expensive food and the gotcha happened just after that!
    - Spent 500$ tasting the 12-course menu from Astrid and Gaston in Lima.
    - But oh boy, I didn't bring my credit card, lol.
    - Lots of weird things happened after that. Worth writing about it at somepoint.
