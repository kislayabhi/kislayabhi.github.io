I have since very recently started realizing that there are certain things out there in the world that I eternally vibe with, out of its natural composition. There are other things that I have to try hard to learn and understand before I can truly say that I enjoy them. On this page, I want to keep a note of all those things that I love watching/reading/listening. 

Movies that I enjoy rewatching
1. [Jab We Met](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1093370/)
2. [Whisper of the Heart](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113824/)

Songs that vibe naturally with me
1. [Little Dark Age](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ETEg-SB01QY&si=m2pNNlSB0dmkBMG4)
2. [Nain Ghat Ghat Tan Ek Ghari](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=AUFzPlBasio&si=Il5JnXQg8sMJMvaw)
