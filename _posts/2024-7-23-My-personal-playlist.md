I have since very recently started realizing that there are certain things out there in the world that I eternally vibe with, out of its natural composition. There are other things that I have to try hard to learn and understand before I can truly say that I enjoy them. On this page, I want to keep a note of all those things that I love watching/reading/listening. 

Movies that I enjoy rewatching
1. [Jab We Met](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1093370/)

Songs that vibe naturally with me
1. [Little Dark Age](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ETEg-SB01QY&si=m2pNNlSB0dmkBMG4)
2. [Nain Ghat Ghat Tan Ek Ghari](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=AUFzPlBasio&si=Il5JnXQg8sMJMvaw)

Poems
1. [कुछ भी बन बस कायर मत बन](http://kavitakosh.org/kk/%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%9B_%E0%A4%AD%E0%A5%80_%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%A8_%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%B8_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B0_%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A4_%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%A8_/_%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0_%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE)
